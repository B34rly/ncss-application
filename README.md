# What?

This is an extra site I made for the NCSS application! I used to rather than a CV (which I've made properly now).
Built with simple HTML/CSS and JQuery

(Upon rereading my code I did it a really weird way. I'm in an exam period so I'm not going to rewrite it to be nicer, if you NCSS people do go this in depth go indepth lmk i'm curious)
